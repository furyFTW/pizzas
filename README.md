#### Project installation and server

Now you've pulled down the repo and have everything setup, using the terminal
you'll need to `cd` into the directory that you cloned the repo into and run
some quick tasks:

```
cd <ngrx-store-effects-app>
yarn install
# OR
npm install
```

This will then setup all the development and production dependencies we need.

Now simply run this to boot up the server:

```
yarn start
# OR
npm start
```

Visit `localhost:3000` to start building.

## Tasks
